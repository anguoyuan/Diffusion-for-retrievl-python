# Diffusion-python
This is diffusion for retrieval instead of image generation. 

This is a copy from https://github.com/ducha-aiki/manifold-diffusion/tree/master. I added FAISS and made more experiments for different features and R1M distractors. Indeed, diffusion always boosts the retrieval performance!!
I find this version gives better performance than https://github.com/fyang93/diffusion, which is also a very good contribution.
