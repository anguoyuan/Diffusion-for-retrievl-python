# Diffusion-python
This is diffusion for retrieval instead of image generation. 

This tutorial is mainly based on Iscen's CVPR17 [paper](https://github.com/ducha-aiki/manifold-diffusion/tree/master. ) and the code of Dmytro Mishkin. https://github.com/ducha-aiki/manifold-diffusion/tree/master. 

I find this version gives better performance than https://github.com/fyang93/diffusion, which is also a very good contribution. 

## Pursuing better retrieval accuracy and faster speed?
The two most famous reranking methods, diffusion and spatial verification, can be combined.
