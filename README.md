# Diffusion-python
This is diffusion for retrieval instead of image generation. 

This tutorial is mainly based on Iscen's CVPR17 [paper]([https://github.com/ducha-aiki/manifold-diffusion/tree/master](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Iscen_Efficient_Diffusion_on_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf)) and the [code](https://github.com/ducha-aiki/manifold-diffusion/tree/master) of Dmytro Mishkin. 

I find this version gives better performance than https://github.com/fyang93/diffusion, which is also a very good contribution. 

## Pursuing better performance?
The two most famous reranking methods, diffusion and spatial verification, can be combined.
